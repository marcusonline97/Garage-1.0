The Garage To do List:

This program is meant to simulate a garage application. It is meant to simulate a simple garage. The ability to park a vehicle, to retrieve a vehicle and also browse to see 
which vehicles are available in the garage and what their properties are. 
All of this will be included in a consoleApp with a mainMenu and some submenus

Garage: A representation of the building. Where a certain amount of vehicles can be stored. The Garage is represented as a collection of Vehicles.

Vehicles: Cars, motorbikes, onewheelers and whichever vehicle we wanna add into the garage.
These are two object types we would see in a physical garage. 
But upon closer review should also have subclasses to vehicle, meaning every vehicle is a subclass in the system.
Besides that functionality which handles vehicles being put in a garage, being retrieved from a garage and also a review of what currently is present within the garage.
So writing out the contents of the garage essentially.

1. Carry a collection of vehicles within the class Garage

2. A Vehicle Klass named Vehicle

3. A certain amount of subclasses for the vehicles.

4. A userinterface which allows us functionality within the garage. Here is where all user interaction will occur

5. A GarageHandler. To abstract a layer which has no real contact between the UserInterface and GarageClass.
